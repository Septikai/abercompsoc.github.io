Hi Everyone!

From September, AberCompSoc will have a new Committee:

 - President - [Aaron Walker](https://github.com/vCra)
 - Vice President - [Josh Smith](https://github.com/Qinusty)

They will be a few more posts to come, especially towards September, as the academic year starts to kick off again.
These will be mainly regarding Freshers Week, Upcoming Events and Elections. 

See you all in September!

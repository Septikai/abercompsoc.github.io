Welcome to the Webpage for the Aberystwyth Computer Science Society

We are a group of students at Aberystwyth with a keen interest in all things
Comp Sci. The society aims to provide an environment where like minded people
can meet and discuss topics of interest as well as increase their own knowledge.

If you're wanting to get into comp-sci at a deeper level and find inspiration and
energy to work on your own things, consider joining us!


Interested? Find our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/abercompsoc) or join us on
[discord](https://discord.gg/3mxCSqj8pK).
